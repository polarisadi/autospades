<h2>Autospades: Automatic Space Debris Extraction System</h2>
    <article>
        <p class="about-info"> Autospades is based on machine learning algorithms and data analytics. Using data from thousands of satellites  
        launched since the beginning of space exploration <br> the plots of ratio of eccentricity and period of satellite in minutes will help
    the system detect which two satellites may be on a collision course and are defunct hence cannot <br>be manually controlled from the 
ground station. This will help the scientists, analysts and engineering to commission a mission that will prevent collision and 
any <br>harm to the ISS and the functioning satellites and also prevent debris scattering in space. Head on to insight to see an example of the process.</p>

<h2>Spades: Space Debris Extraction System</h2>
<article>
    <p class="about-info"> Spades is an automated satellite concept that will have a hatch to pick up 
         small debris and attach or capture a large satellite <br> or debris from a satellite and continue it's atmospheric reentry to burn up all
         all the debris it captured. The boosters it will <br> use to launch  to space will be recoverable and hence can be used for another mission.
